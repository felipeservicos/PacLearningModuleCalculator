With an increasing number of machine learning algorithms emerging, it is important to pay attention to learning capacity. Large volumes of data and misdimensioning of an algorithm can result in significant project costs, team time, reengineering, and training failures.

In order to help mitigate these problems, the PAC Learning Module Calculator has been developed, which can suggest effective machine learning algorithms for your project.

Please feel free to suggest improvements!
